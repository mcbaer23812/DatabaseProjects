It returns 1 if the input string is a valid date format and 0 otherwise. This function is useful when dealing with user input, ensuring that values can be safely processed without causing errors in date-based calculations. For example, SELECT ISDATE('20220212') returns 1, confirming that it is a valid date, while SELECT ISDATE('20220230') returns 0, as February 30th does not exist. This function is particularly helpful in data validation, where it ensures that incorrect or malformed dates do not disrupt query execution._\n",

Various functions, including DATEFROMPARTS, DATETIME2FROMPARTS, and TIMEFROMPARTS, cater to different levels of precision and types of date-time representations. For instance, DATEFROMPARTS(2022, 02, 12) returns the date 2022-02-12, while DATETIMEFROMPARTS(2022, 02, 12, 13, 30, 5, 997) constructs a full timestamp.

For example, SELECT EOMONTH(SYSDATETIME()) returns the last day of the current month, while EOMONTH('20220212', 1) returns the last day of the following month, March 2022. The EOMONTH function simplifies date calculations in scenarios such as financial reporting, where determining the end of a billing cycle or fiscal month is crucial. It eliminates the need for manual date manipulation, making queries cleaner and more efficient._\n",

This technique subtracts a reference date, such as '18991231', from the target date in terms of months, then adds that difference back to the reference date. While more complex than EOMONTH, this method allows flexibility in computing not only the last day of a month but also other time-based aggregations like the start or end of a quarter or year. This approach is valuable when working in environments where built-in functions like EOMONTH may not be available or when fine-tuned control over date calculations is required._\n",

The function accepts three arguments: start\\_value, stop\\_value, and an optional step\\_value, which defines the increment. By default, the step value is 1 for increasing sequences and -1 for decreasing sequences. For example, SELECT value FROM GENERATE\\_SERIES(1, 10) produces numbers from 1 to 10. This function is particularly useful for generating sequences of dates when combined with DATEADD. For instance, it can create a list of all dates in a given year by incrementing days from a start date. This capability is beneficial in time-series analysis, reporting, and simulations._\n",

Metadata queries can help database administrators and developers inspect table structures, check column properties, and optimize queries based on database schemas. For example, querying sys.tables lists all tables within a database, while sys.columns provides details about the columns in a specific table.

For example, querying INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA.TABLES lists all base tables in a database, while INFORMATION\\_SCHEMA.COLUMNS provides information about a table’s columns.
